  The Truthful Art: Alberto Cairo response 
  </h1>
  <p>
  The norms and expectations stated in the book <q><i> The Truthful Art </q> by Alberto Cairo</i>, basically explain how to use the correct form measure of central tendency. The three different kinds of central tendencies are Mean, Median and Mode and there are also sub-categories for each central tendency. For example, there can be a regular boring mean or a weighted mean, which takes into account the differences between the data of the subjects given. For the median, it can sometimes be more accurate than the mean because some numbers in the mean would mess up the average. By this I am relating it to salaries and other data that would produce this issue because some salaries are much higher than others and thus, wouldn't account for what the average person makes, but what the average salary is- and that isn't really helpful. The median in this case would account for what the mean missed, aka what the average person makes. Finally the mode is basically what shows up most often. I found an interest in the second half of Chapter 6 when <i>Cairo</i> informed us about the different types of ways ranges can be used to help visually analyze data. In the book he states that range plots/graphs show details of the information that we might've missed. He spoke about how a range plot easily showed us how a country can have the best schools and worst schools. He also wrote about how varying range graphs or plots can show us different levels of detail, which is why he advised us that if we use a range graph, to not only use one because their might be something that you missed.
